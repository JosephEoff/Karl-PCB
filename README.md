KiCad project files for the Arduino shield used with the [Karl software.](https://github.com/JosephEoff/Karl)

Karl-PCB, [Karl,](https://github.com/JosephEoff/Karl) [Grote,](https://github.com/JosephEoff/Grote) and the hardware described under [scanner-hardware-drawings](https://github.com/JosephEoff/scanner-hardware-drawings) are all used together to make images of 12GHz RF.


The schematics and layout in the "ScannerBoard" folder are the latest revision I have built and used.  You must change some of the parts for it to work properly.

The schematics and layout in the ScannerBoard-Revised" folder have the modifications already made, but I have never had a board made to test the changes.

Both folders contain datasheets of the more critical components of the circuit.
